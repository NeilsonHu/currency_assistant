# Currency Assistant

This is a demo server & app for quering the latest currency and booking a notification of custom currency score.

# Why

I enter CA at about Feb/2022. At that time, I could find no app which would satisfy me for checking the currency of CAD(Canada dollar) to CNH(RMB offshore) and making a notification for free without personal information leaking when the currency score is approaching my custom level. So I decided to develop an app by myself and for myself, even it might cost. Besides, I can take this chance to upgrade my github projects and publish a new app, and learn to practice my SwiftUI or Flutter experience.

# What

So the whole package contains an iOS app using Siwft & SwiftUI (or maybe Flutter) and a server built up by node.js.
